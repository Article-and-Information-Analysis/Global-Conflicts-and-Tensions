In a significant escalation of tensions between Ukraine and Russia, reports have emerged detailing the destruction of a large Russian landing ship, the Tsezar Kunikov, by Ukrainian drones near occupied Crimea. The incident marks a notable setback for Vladimir Putin's Black Sea naval fleet.

According to Ukrainian military sources, the attack took place off the coast of Crimea in the Black Sea. The Ukrainian Armed Forces, supported by the Defense Ministry's intelligence unit, have claimed responsibility for the destruction of the Tsezar Kunikov, citing its presence within Ukrainian territorial waters near Alupka at the time of the assault.

Evidence provided by Ukraine's Main Directorate of Intelligence includes a video purportedly showing Magura V5 sea drones inflicting critical damage to the ship's port side, leading to its eventual sinking. Ukrainian authorities attribute the operation to a unit identified as Group 13.

Initial reports of the incident were disseminated by Ukrainska Pravda, a leading Ukrainian media outlet, which shared footage capturing smoke emanating from the sea off Crimea's southern coast, accompanied by images of helicopters patrolling the area.

The targeted vessel, identified as a 112-meter Russian Ropucha-class landing ship with an estimated crew of 50, reportedly capsized and sank rapidly following multiple strikes from the sea drones. While Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksiy Honcharenko has affirmed the identity of the vessel as the Tsezar Kunikov, independent verification of this claim remains pending.

Earlier on the same day, the Russian state agency RIA reported that Russia's air defense systems had intercepted and neutralized nine drones launched from Ukraine over various regions, including the Black Sea. Of these, six were reportedly intercepted over the Black Sea itself, as confirmed by the Russian defense ministry.

This incident contributes to a series of confrontations between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the region. In December, Ukrainian cruise missiles targeted and inflicted damage on a significant Russian landing warship in Crimea, resulting in casualties. Similar reports emerged earlier this month regarding the targeting of a Russian corvette in the Black Sea.

While land-based frontlines in the conflict remain largely static, with minimal gains by Russian forces, Ukrainian actions have precipitated notable adjustments in the strategic posture of Putin's Black Sea Fleet. The loss of the fleet's flagship warship, Moskva, in spring 2022 underscores this evolving dynamic. Recent developments suggest an ongoing effort by Ukraine to challenge Russian naval supremacy in the region, complemented by strikes on Russian airfields and the reported downing of a spy plane, which have reportedly impaired the operational capacity of the Russian air force.
