In a recent development in the ongoing tensions between Ukraine and Russia, a significant blow was dealt to Vladimir Putin's Black Sea naval fleet. Reports emerged of a large Russian landing ship, the Tsezar Kunikov, being destroyed by Ukrainian drones near occupied Crimea.

According to Ukrainian military sources, the attack occurred off the coast of Crimea in the Black Sea. The Ukrainian Armed Forces, aided by the Defense Ministry's intelligence unit, claimed responsibility for the destruction of the Tsezar Kunikov, which was reportedly within Ukrainian territorial waters near Alupka at the time of the strike.

Ukraine's Main Directorate of Intelligence released a video allegedly showing Magura V5 sea drones delivering the decisive blows to the ship. The footage depicted the vessel suffering critical damage to its port side before beginning to sink. Ukrainian authorities attributed the attack to a unit known as Group 13.

Initial reports of the incident surfaced from Ukrainska Pravda, a prominent Ukrainian media outlet, which shared videos capturing smoke rising from the sea off Crimea's southern coast and helicopters hovering over the area.

The targeted vessel, identified as a 112-meter Russian Ropucha-class landing ship with an estimated 50 crew members, reportedly capsized and quickly sank after sustaining multiple hits from the sea drones. While Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksiy Honcharenko asserted that the Tsezar Kunikov was the ship in question, independent verification of this claim or the accompanying footage is yet to be obtained.

Earlier on the same day, Russian state agency RIA reported that Russia's air defense systems had intercepted and destroyed nine drones launched from Ukraine over various regions, including the Black Sea. Six of these drones were reportedly neutralized over the Black Sea itself, as confirmed by the Russian defense ministry.

This incident adds to a series of confrontations between Ukrainian and Russian forces in the region. In December, Ukrainian cruise missiles targeted and struck a large Russian landing warship in Crimea, resulting in casualties. Reports also emerged earlier this month of a Russian corvette being targeted in the Black Sea.

While the land frontlines in the conflict remain largely static, with limited gains by Russian forces, Ukrainian attacks have forced significant shifts in the disposition of Putin's Black Sea Fleet. The flagship warship, Moskva, was sunk in spring 2022, and recent actions suggest a continued effort by Ukraine to challenge Russian naval dominance in the region. Additionally, Ukrainian strikes on Russian airfields and the downing of a spy plane have reportedly hampered the effectiveness of the Russian air force.
